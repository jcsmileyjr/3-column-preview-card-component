### What I learned

1. Retouched the BEM naming conventions
2. Brief reminder of how to utilize a SVG image.
3. Realized how much more practice I need with responsive designs

Sample code below showing BEM naming conventions(Block-Element-Modifier) !!!
```html
        <article class="sedan">
          <section>
            <img src="images/icon-sedans.svg" class="sedan__image" alt="sudan car" />
            <h2>Sedans</h2>
            <p class="sedan__content">
              Choose a sedan for its affordability and excellent fuel economy. Ideal for cruising in the city 
            or on your next road trip.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <button type="button" class="sedan__button">Learn More</button>
          </section>
        </article>
```
